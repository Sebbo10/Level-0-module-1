# Goal: Write a Python program that asks the user for the radius 
#       of a circle and displays the area of that circle.
#       The formula for the area of a circle is Ï€r^2.
#       See example image in package to check your output.

    # Have your turtle draw a circle with the correct radius

    # Move your turtle to a new x,y position using .goto()
